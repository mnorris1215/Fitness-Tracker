# Fitness-Tracker
This website is to encourage healthy living by incorporating Nietzschean philosophy. It will contain a way to track workout
regime, weight, eating, and other minor details. In addition, it will teach a "success through pain" principle, and may serve 
as a blog platform as well. 

As a warning, this is one of many projects from a beginning developer. So stay tuned for consistent updates.
